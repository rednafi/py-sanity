# Guidelines

## Auto-formatters
* Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black/) with default settings (max character length 88 lines).
* Use [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) to catch linting errors.
* Use [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) to sort the imports.

    => However, be careful while sorting imports of application modules. It might accidentally add circular dependencies. For example in Flask applications, changing the import order in flask `app/package/__init__.py` can mess up the codebase.

    ```python
    from flask import Blueprint

    package = Blueprint("package", __name__)

    from . import views
    ```

    To avoid this, add `# isort:skip` like this:

    ```python
    from flask import Blueprint

    package = Blueprint("package", __name__)

    from . import views # isort:skip
    ```

    => Black is not compatible with isort. So it's better to run black after running isort.


## Functions

* Avoid mutable data types as default function/method aruments.

    ```python
    # bad
    def make_list(val, lst=[]):
        lst.append(val)
        return lst

    make_list(1)
    # => [1]
    make_list(2)
    # => [1, 2], instead of the new init [2]

    # good
    def make_list(val, lst=None):
        if lst is None:
            lst = []
        lst.append(val)
        return lst

    init_list(1)
    # => [1]
    init_list(2)
    # => [2]
    ```

*  Robert C. Martin's [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) encourages that a function should only have a single responsibility. That is, it should do one thing and one thing only. It massively improves refactorability.

    ==> There can be only one reason ever to change the function: if the way in which it does that thing must change.

    ==> It also becomes clear when a function can be deleted: if, when making changes elsewhere, it becomes clear the function's single responsibility is no longer needed, simply remove it.

    ```python
    # bad
    # this function calculates multiple things and print them out at the same time
    # ideally these two responsibilities can be split into two functions

    def calculate_and_print_stats(list_of_numbers):
        total = sum(list_of_numbers)
        mean = statistics.mean(list_of_numbers)
        median = statistics.median(list_of_numbers)
        mode = statistics.mode(list_of_numbers)

        print("-----------------Stats-----------------")
        print(f"SUM: {total}")
        print(f"MEAN: {mean}")
        print(f"MEDIAN: {median}")
        print(f"MODE: {mode}")
    ```

    ```python
    # good
    # these two functions do the same things but each of them
    # only has a single responsibility

    def calculate_statistics(list_of_numbers):
        """Calculates arithmatic sum, mean, median and mode."""

        total = sum(list_of_numbers)
        mean = statistics.mean(list_of_numbers)
        median = statistics.median(list_of_numbers)
        mode = statistics.mode(list_of_numbers)

        return total, mean, median, mode


    def print_statistics(total, mean, median, mode):
        """Prints statistics on the console."""

        print("-----------------Stats-----------------")
        print(f"SUM: {total}")
        print(f"MEAN: {mean}")
        print(f"MEDIAN: {median}")
        print(f"MODE: {mode}")
    ```

* Strive to write **pure** or at least **idempotent** functions as much as possible.

    ==> **An idempotent function** always returns the same value given the same set of arguments, regardless of how many times it is called. The result does not depend on non-local variables, the mutability of arguments, or data from any I/O streams.

    The following function is idempotent. The result of `square_num(5)` is always going to return `25`, regardless of how many times it is called:

    ```python
    def square_num(number):
        """This is an idempotent function."""

        return number ** 2
    ```

    This function takes in user input and is not idempotent.
    ```python
    def square_num():
        """Return number_entered_by_user ** 2."""

        number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
        return number ** 2
    ```

    **Why:**
    Idempotent functions are easy to test because they are guaranteed to always return the same result when called with the same arguments. Testing is simply a matter of checking that the value returned by various different calls to the function return the expected value.

    ==> **A function is considered pure** if it is both idempotent and has no observable side effects. For example, if the idempotent version of square_func(number)above printed the result before returning it or mutated a variable outside of the function scope, it is still considered idempotent because while it accessed an I/O stream. However, it would not remain a pure function anymore.

    ```python
    a_variable = 0

    def square_num(number):
        """Idempotent but not pure."""

        sq_num = number ** 2
        a_variable += square_num

        return sq_num
    ```

    **Why:** Pure functions are even easier to test than idempotent functions. They don't keep any footprint outside of the function scope. Also, they don't call any non-pure functions. It's basically a data-in-data-out pipeline.




## Docstring
* Use [numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) style docstring. This is a good format that uses extra vertical space for maximum readability.

    ```python
    def dumb_add(num0, num1, num2, num3, num4):
        """[summary]

        Parameters
        ----------
        num0 : [type]
            [description]
        num1 : [type]
            [description]
        num2 : [type]
            [description]
        num3 : [type]
            [description]
        num4 : [type]
            [description]

        Returns
        -------
        [type]
            [description]
        """
    ```

* Single line docstring.

    ```python
    def dumb_sub(num1, num0):
        """Subtracting num0 from num1."""
    ```
* Inline comments should start with lowercase letter.

    ```python
    # going through the student list
    for idx, student in enumerate(students_list):
        ...
    ```


## Imports

* Do not use wild card import

    ```python
    # bad
    from mod import *
    from package.mod import *

    # good
    from mod import func_0
    from package.mod import func_1
    ```

* Do not import unused modules (Flake8 will point out unused imports, make sure you remove them before committing).

* Sort the imports by import then from, and sort alphabetically (`isort` will automatically do this for you).

    ```python
    # bad
    from a_mod import foo
    import e_mod
    import b_mod
    from z_mod import bar, baz

    # good
    import b_mod
    import e_mod
    from a_mod import foo
    from z_mod import bar, baz
    ```

* Use absolute imports in your production code. Relative imports can be messy, particularly for shared projects where directory structure is likely to change. Consider this directory structure:

    ```bash
    └── project
    └── package1
       ├── module1.py
       └── module2.py

    ```
    ```python
    # package1/module1

    # bad
    from .module2 import func

    # good
    from package1.module2 import func
    ```


## Whitespaces
* Use soft tabs (space character) set to 4 spaces as per PEP8.

    ```python
    # bad
    def foo():
    ∙∙return bar

    # bad
    def foo():
    ∙return bar

    # good
    def foo():
    ∙∙∙∙return bar
    ```

## Naming Conventions

* Use *snake_case* when naming **variables**, **functions**, and **instances**. Use it for *file names* too as they will be used in imports.

    ```python
    # bad
    import myMod
    anOBJEct = {}
    thisIsAnObject = {}
    def ThisisAFunction():

    # good
    import my_mod
    anobject = {}
    this_is_an_object = {}
    def this_is_a_function():
    ```

* **Global constants**, that are usually defined on a module level, should be named in all captital letters with underscores separating words.

    ```python
    # bad
    global_constant = 50

    # good
    GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 50
    ```
* Use PascalCase only when naming **classes**.

    ```python
    # bad
    class exampleDummyFactory():
        # ...

    fact = exampleDummyFactory()

    # good
    class ExampleDummyFactory():
        # ...

    fact = ExampleDummyFactory()
    ```

* Avoid single letter names. Use descriptive and meaningful names - tell what the function does,
or what data type an object is. Use `description_object` instead of `object_description`.

    ```python
    # bad
    def a():
        # ...

    # good
    def analogy():
        # ...

    # bad - no convention to know what data type it is
    df_raw_data = pd.DataFrame(raw_data)
    id_dct_num = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

    # good - convention to tell data type by the last term
    raw_data_df = pd.DataFrame(raw_data)
    id_num_dct = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

    # bad - meaningless names, lost context
    LIST_1 = ["Jack", "Alice", "Emily"]
    # ... many lines of code later
    for item in LIST_1:
        add_person(item)

    # good
    NAME_LIST = ["Jack", "Alice", "Emily"]
    # ... many lines of code later
    for name in NAME_LIST:
        add_person(name)
    ```

* Use singular or base words in naming; avoid using plural and instead append singular with the data type.

    ```python
    # bad
    def moves_object(x, y):
        # ...

    # good
    def move_object(x, y):
        # ...

    # bad - inconsistent naming for same data type and usage
    teacher = ["Michael"]
    students = ["Jack", "Alice", "Emily"]
    books = pd.DataFrame({"title": ["lorem", "ipsum"]})

    for t in teacher:
        add_human(t)

    for student in students:
        add_human(student)

    for book in books:
        add_item(book) # wrong; iterate column name instead of book

    # good
    teacher_list = ["Michael"]
    student_list = ["Jack", "Alice", "Emily"]
    book_df = pd.DataFrame({"title": ["lorem", "ipsum"]})

    for teacher in teacher_list:
        add_human(teacher)

    for student in student_list:
        add_human(student)

    # naming as df suggests it shall be treated as a dataframe
    for idx, book in book_df.iterrow():
        add_item(book)
    ```


## Exception Handling

* Do not write bare try-except block

    ```python
    # bad
    try:
        do_something()
    except:
        pass

    # bad
    try:
        do_something()
    except Exception:
        pass
    ```

* In most cases, the caught exception type must be as specific as possible. Something like KeyError, or ConnectionTimeout, etc.

    ```python
    # good
    try:
        do_something()
    # catch some very specific exception - KeyError, ValueError, etc.
    except ValueError:
        pass
    ```

* If some code path simply must broadly catch all exceptions - for example, the top-level loop for some long-running persistent process - then each such caught exception must write the full stack trace to a log or file, along with a timestamp. Not just the exception type and message, but the full stack trace.

    ```python
    # good
    def get_number():
        return int("foo")

    try:
        x = get_number()
    except ValueError:
        pass
    except Exception:
        logging.exception("Caught an error", exec_info=True)
    ```

## Logging
* Instantiate your logger in your package's `__init__.py` module. See how it's done in `requests` library [here.](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)

* Define a basic logging class

   ```python
    # __init__.py
    # demo of a global logger that can be called and used anywhere in your package

    import logging

    logging.getLogger(__name__)

    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format="%\n(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s",
        handlers=[logging.FileHandler("packg/debug.log"), logging.StreamHandler()],
    )
    ```

* Import and use it like this

    ```python
    # mod.py
    # using the logging class defined in __init__.py

    from . import logging

    def dumb_div(a):
        try:
            res = a // 0
        except ValueError:
            res = a // 1
        except Exception:
            logging.exception("Exception Occured")
            res = None

        return res

    dumb_div(5)
    ```
 * For logging in production applications, use [Sentry's Logging](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/logging/). You can view your logs in the Sentry Dashboard.

   ```python
   # __init__.py

   import logging
   import sentry_sdk
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import LoggingIntegration

   sentry_logging = LoggingIntegration(
       level=logging.INFO,  # Capture info and above as breadcrumbs
       event_level=logging.ERROR,  # Send errors as events
   )
   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="<sign-up-for-sentry-and-you-will-get-your-dsn>",
       integrations=[sentry_logging],
   )
   ```

   ```python
   # mod.py
   # using the sentry logging class defined in __init__.py

   from . import logging

   def dumb_div(a):
        try:
            res = a // 0
        except ValueError:
            res = a // 1
        except Exception:
            logging.exception("Exception Occured")
            res = None

        return res

    dumb_div(5)
   ```

    ```
    # folder structure of the logging demo package
    packg
    ├── debug.log
    ├── __init__.py
    └── mod.py
    ```


## Testing
* Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to write your tests

* Strive to write many small [pure](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47245930/8963300) and [idempotent](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077412/what-is-an-idempotent-operation) functions, and minimize where mutations occur.

* Whenever you fix a bug, write a regression test. A bug fixed without a regression test is almost certainly going to break again in the future.

* Use direct assertations and explicit comparisons; avoid negations.

    ```python
    # bad - other values can be falsy too: `[], 0, '', None`
    assert not result
    assert result_list

    # good
    assert result == False
    assert len(result_list) > 0
    ```

## Flask

### Project Structure

Try to follow **divisional structure** while designing your microservice APIs.
Here's an example of divisional structure in a Flask project.

```
yourapp/
    __init__.py
    admin/
        __init__.py
        views.py
        static/
        templates/
    home/
        __init__.py
        views.py
        static/
        templates/
    control_panel/
        __init__.py
        views.py
        static/
        templates/
    models.py
```
